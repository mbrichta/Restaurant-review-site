# Restaurant-review-site
Openclassrooms: Project 7

I need help with a few things:

  -Fix responsiveness problem where buttons and the buttom of the cards don't stack.
  -Some general help with responsiveness would be good.
  -I have triend everything to center the Intro-text and searchbar in the middle of the video but no success yet :/
  -Im algo getting an error message when I run the getMyLocation() method.It got my VPN location but it didnt show the InfoWindow. 
   Something about a .get() but I dont exactly now what it is.
  
What I have accomplished:
  -Display the list of restaurants.
  -Show the restaurant Markers on the map.
  -Display the avg stars rating.
  -Add reviews about existing restaurants.
  -Add a restaurant by clicking on the map. 
  
To-Do's (there's probably more):
  -Google maps will focus on the users Geolocation (Almost done)
  -View reviews of restaurants.
  -Go to google street view.
  -A filter tool that allows to search avg rating.
  -Use API to find restaurants in a particular area. (I'm getting my feet wet with the API stuff but I might manage this untill our next meeting)
