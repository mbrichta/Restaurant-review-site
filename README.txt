Openclassrooms: Project 7

Things I need help with:
  -PlaceService error: Uncaught TypeError: b is not a function.
  -Not sure how i should create single restaurant page. 
  
To-Do's (there's probably more):
  -Create single Restaurant page with places API. Get detailed info with placeID
  -Display streetview of restaurant in restaurant page.
  -A filter tool that allows to search avg rating.
  -Finish Carousel (add Text or buttons)
